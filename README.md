Magnet rest2mobile generates native code for mobile apps from REST-JSON APIs. It turns actual REST requests and responses into source code (Objective-C, Android, and JavaScript) that you can call from your mobile app. The source code automatically handles:

* server connections
* marshaling and unmarshaling JSON data
* JSON data conversion to the correct data types

In your mobile app code, you call the generated methods with type-safe entities and will receive a response object.

## Get Started

rest2mobile provides plugins for Android Studio/IntelliJ IDEA and Xcode that allow you to specify REST requests and JSON responses, and generate platform-specific code, all within the IDE. rest2mobile also has a command-line tool called 
<code>r2m</code> that can generate iOS, Android, or JavaScript code. All of these tools are available from Github.

## Set Up rest2mobile for Android Studio and IntelliJ IDEA

[r2m-plugin-android](https://github.com/magnetsystems/r2m-plugin-android) repository. There you can find the latest release, as well as instructions for setting up your IDE to use rest2mobile.
